# Deep-Fake-Detector
Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains the code for [Deep Fake Detector], which I am excited to share as part of my portfolio.

Important Note: Due to project privacy concerns, the repository is private, and the code is not publicly accessible. However, to provide a comprehensive overview of the project, I have included images in this README file.

If you would like to discuss the project further or arrange a call to view the code, please feel free to email me at [dev.qasim3@gmail.com].
